## Learning how to use Markdown

1. Markdown is a "Syntax" that is more simple to write and can easily be translated into HTML through other programs.  
2. Hashtags are called octothorps, they are used to designate headings. Adding more octothorps reduces the size/importance of your heading.   
4. Double space after your text in order to create a new line on the document.  
5. To create a bulleted list just use either a - or * symbol.    
6. Quote text using the > symbol.  
7. You can create a link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).Here is the link to the Basic formatting syntax for Markdown that i have been provided. [Basics of Markdown]{ https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#uploading-assets}.  
8. This is also the same way to add an image to your Markdown. Place an ! before the brackets to show the image, if you do not add the ! it will instead show the link to said image.  
9. To add a downloaded image onto your Markdown you first need to download the file onto Github itself.  
10. To add Emoji's use the colon symbol üëä. A list of emojis will appear and filter as you type in what you're looking for üçå.

- Keep Github Presentable! Github will be used in the future hiring process as a software developer. Keep everything on there very proffesional as it is public.  
- A repository in Github is similar to a big folder. Think of it as your current project.
