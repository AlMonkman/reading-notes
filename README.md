# Intoduction  
Hello! Welcome to my first Github repository. My name is Alan Monkman, I am currently 26 years old and live just North of Seattle Washington. I previously worked for USPS but decided it was time to get into a career path that I would truly enjoy. I've created this website so I can easily bounce between all the notes that I am taking in course 102 and 201 at Code Fellows. Click on any of the links below to go to that page of notes. Enjoy!
