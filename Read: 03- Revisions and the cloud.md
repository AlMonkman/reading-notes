# Git Intro  

---

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording the changes. This is very similar to commiting the changes on your Github document, except you can do it locally. It is very useful for co-collaberating with other coders on a single project.  

This also eliminates the risk of the server going down, and no-one being able to work until it is restored.  

## What is Git?  

---

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Every time you commit a change to your file, you are creating a new snapshot. This is useful in case something goes wrong and you need to restore it to a previous version.  

Git works in three different stages.  

-**Committed**-Data is securely stored in a local database

-**Modified**-File has been changed but not committed to the database  

-**Staged**-Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
