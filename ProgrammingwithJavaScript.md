# Control Flow  

---

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in the file from the first line to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow. Such as conditionals and loops. Parts of the script may also be set to execute when *events* occur.  

# Functions  

---

-A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  
-A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).  
-A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().  
-The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:  
-The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}   

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {  
  // code to be executed  
} 

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.  
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.  
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.  

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:  

1.When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)  
2.When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code  
3.Automatically (self invoked)  

# Operators

**JavaScript Arithmetic Operators**  
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:  

\+	Addition  
\-	Subtraction  
\*	Multiplication  
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)  
/	Division  
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)  
++	Increment  
--	Decrement  

**JavaScript Assignment Operators**  
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.  

Operator || 	  Example|| 	    Same As   
=	||             x = y ||       x = y  
+= ||           x += y	||       x = x + y  
-=	||          x -= y	||       x = x - y  
*=	||          x *= y	||       x = x * y  
/=  ||        	x /= y	||       x = x / y  
%=  ||        	x %= y	||       x = x % y  
**=	 ||         x **= y	||       x = x ** y  

The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.  
Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string.  

**JavaScript Comparison Operators**  
Operator||	Description  
==	|| equal to  
===	|| equal value and equal type  
!=	|| not equal  
!==||	not equal value or not equal type  
\>	|| greater than  
<	|| less than  
>=	|| greater than or equal to  
<=	|| less than or equal to  
?	|| ternary operator
