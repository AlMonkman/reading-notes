## Basic Markdown Syntax, Markdown on Github  

---

-Create headings using #'s. The more Haskhtags(Octothorps) you use will decrease the size/importance of the heading.  
-To create a numbered list simply put the desired number at the start of each new line. To create unordered lists use a -, *, or + symbol.  
-To **bold** Surround the word with two * symbols on each side. To *italisize* place one * symbol on each side. To ***bold and italisize*** place three on each side.   
-To quote place a > at the start of the line. For a block quote add at the front of the paragraph.  
-To create a line break simply put a double space at the end of your previous sentence.  
-Create a hyperlink by putting the title of your link inside []brackets and the link inside () parenthesis following the brackets. [Title](Url).  
-This is the same way to put an image on your page. [Title of image](url of image) if you want the image itself to show on your page you need to preceed the brackets with an !. It looks like this ![Title](Url).  
-To denote a word or phrase as code, surround it with backticks. `Code`  
-For a Horizontal rule place three or more *** asterisks, --- dashes, or ___ underscores.   
-To display one of the characters used above, without turning it into code simply place a / backslash in front of it.  



##  Github pages  
 Github is a very user friendly way for anybody to get their projects out on the internet. In many cases without any need to even learn HTML. The simplicity allows people to focus on the content they want to put on their site, and not worry about the code. Your projects are also public. This allows other people/co-collaberators to easily join in and provide their input.
