## Images  

- You can control the size of images using the height and width properties as with any other box.  
- You can set predetermined values for the height and width of your images. You determine the size of the image, then give it a name. You will then use that name as the value you put on your images.  
- By default images are inline elements. To center you need to turn them into block level elements.  

**Background Images**  

- The background image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.  
- The path to the image follows the letters url in parenthesis and quotes.  
- You can repeat your image using the background-repeat property, you then determine whether you want it to repeat along the x or y axis. (repeat-x or repeat-y)  
- To determine where in the browser you want the image to be placed you would use the background-position property. Followed by a pair of values, the first representing the horizontal position and the latter representing the vertical.  

The background property is the shorthand way to use all other background properties in one line. They must be specified in the following order.  

- background-color  
- background-image  
- background-repeat  
- background-attachment  
- background-position  

Using CSS it is possible to create a link or button that changes uto a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as rollover), and again when it is clicked.  
When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface it is known as a sprite. This is helpful as it will reduce the number of images your browser has to load.
