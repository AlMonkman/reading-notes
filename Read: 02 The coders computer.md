Text editors can be a very helpful tool for writing out your code. There are many different versions out there, and choosing one really comes down to preference. They can do all sorts of things including.  
-Code completion  
-Syntax highlighting  
-Access to a different variety of themes  
-Access to all sorts of different extensions that you can pick from.  

Extensions are things that you will continue to add onto you text editor if you so desire. Your extensions will grow with you as you grow as a coder.  

## Working with your terminal, The command line  
 ---
 
 -The command line is where you will enter commands in your terminal.  
 -You will recieve lines of text in response to your actions.  
 -You will follow your commands with what are called "arguments".  
 -Make sure there is a space between your original command and said argument.  
 -Arguments are used to modify the command, and typically begin with a dash.  
 -Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands for you.  
 -Use the command "echo" to dispaly what shell your system is currently using.  
 
 ## Basic navigation  
 
 ---
 
 -PWD (print working directory) will show where your current directory is.  
 -Alot of commands in the terminal rely on being in the correct location, PWD can help you figure out where you are.  
 -The ls (list) command will show us the plain listing of our directory.  
 -If you add arguments to the ls funtion it can show you much more.  
 -ls -l Will show you a long listing of your current directory.  
 -ls /etc will show you the directory contents.  
 -And you can combine that all together to show a long listing of the directory and its current contents. It looks like this. "ls -l /etc".  
 -You will need to use paths to navigate through your files using the terminal.  
 -In order to move through paths you use a command called "cd" (change directory)  
 -It will ususally be run with a single command line argument, designating where we would like to move too.  
 
 ## About files  
 
 ---
 
 -Every single thing in your set up is a file.  
 -The following are most basic files.  
 -file.exe - an executable file, or program.  
-file.txt - a plain text file.  
-file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.  
-Linux ***IS*** Case sensitive.  
-Be careful when interacting with files that have a space in their name.  
-Use / Or put quotes around the words to make sure the space is not recognized as a command.  
-To show hidden files you must add a -a to you command. For example ls -a will list out the files including the hidden ones.
