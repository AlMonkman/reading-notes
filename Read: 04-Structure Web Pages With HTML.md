# Wireframe  
 
 ---
 
 -Wireframe is a practice which allows you to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.  
 -This is where you will decide where everything will go in plain black and white.  
 -You can create these using simple pencil and paper. Or on a whiteboard app.  
 -Think from the perspective of the person who will be using your product. What are they there for? What will they be doing the most there? Etc.  
 
 **Here are 6 important steps to creating your wireframe.**  
 1. Do your research.  
 2. Prepare your research for quick reference.  
 3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.  
 4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.  
 5. Add some detail and get testing.  
 6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.  

**Three key concepts to make a successful wire frame.**  
1. Clarity  
2. Confidence  
3. Simplicity  


# H.T.M.L. Hypertext Markup Language  

---

HTML is a Markup language that defines the structure of your content. It consists of a series of elements which you use to *enclose or wrap* diferent parts of your content to make it look a certain way. 

**There are four main parts to an element**  
1. **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.  
2. **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.  
3. **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.  
4. **The element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.  

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you dont want to appear in your actual content. These are often used to target said element and any others that share the same tag, in order to stylize them.  
All of these elements are combined in order to form an entire HTML page.  

## Semantics  

---

In programming semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.  In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of a top level heading on your page. By default most browsers will style an h1 with a large font size to make it *look* like a heading. You can alternitively input all the attributes (mentioned above) to manually make it look the way you want. But keep in mind it will not have any semantic value and will not recieve the same benifits.
