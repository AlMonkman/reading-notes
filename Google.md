# What Google Learned About Teams  
---

In the past few decades it seems that time spent by employees in collaborative work has increased by 50% or more. More than 75% of an average employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues.  

Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. They also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.  

In 2012 Google embarked on an initiative called Project Aristotle. Led by Julia Rozovsky, this project's goal was to analyze there employees and their habits to understand which groups of people would be more successfull in working together.  

There were few patterns that they could find, but there were two solid reocurring themes in the successfull groups.  

- Members would speak in roughly the same proportion.  
- Also the members of the good teams all tended to have *average social sensitivity*.  

These traits are aspects of what is known as psychological safety. A climate in which people are comfortable being themselves. Finding this safe environment seemed to be the key in group productivity. The who of the matter really isn't as important, It's the social environment the group is in.
