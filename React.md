# Introduction to React and Components.  

---

It seems that React is going to be an important part of our 301 journey. These basics will help us to start said journey. 

## Component-Based Architecture.  

*1. What is a component?*  

A Component is a JavaScript class or function, that optionally accepts input (props) and returns a React element.  

*2. What are the characteristics of a component?*  

- Path
- Component name
- Component type name
- Version number
- Platform
- Label
- Category
- Description
- Source
- Component Variables
- Procedures
- Hidden  

*3. What are the advantages to using component based architecture?*  

Ease of deployment- As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components of the system.  

## What is Props and How to Use it in React.  

*1. What is props short for?*  

Props is short for properties. Arguments that are passed into React components.  

*2. How are props used in React?*  

Props are used to pass data from one component to another. Parent component to a child component. 

*3. What is The Flow of Props?*  

We learned that with react the data flows down. The props are used to pass the data from the parent component to it's child components. In JSX you can have only one parent HTML element and all other elements are nested under that parent.
